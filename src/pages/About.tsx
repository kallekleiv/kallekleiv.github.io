        <p>
          I'm a software developer with a background in computer engineering and a M.Sc in
          Informatics, specialized in artificial intelligence. Currently I'm one year through a
          three year IT architecture graduate program in a bank.
        </p>
        <p>
          My primary stack includes <strong>TypeScript</strong>, <strong>React</strong>,
          <strong>Node.js</strong>, and <strong>PostgreSQL</strong>. I'm also comfortable with CI/CD
          workflows, Docker, and cloud infrastructure.
        </p>
        <p>Outside of work, I like running, strength training, and Brazilian jiu-jitsu.</p>
